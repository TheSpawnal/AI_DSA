# the following code implements a Job class (similar to Assignment 1 Task 3), where p is processing time and w is importance;
# a job finishing at time t has a cost of t*w. 
# The goal is to sequence jobs to minimize the total cost, using Smith’s rule (scheduling jobs by the order if their ratio of processing time over weight ratio).
# This greedy rule turns out to be optimal. 
# The code implement a quick sort. This time, differently from the assignment, we do not care if the order of equal jobs is the same both in the input and the output, 
# if the jobs are equal according to == then they can be in whatever order.


# pseudocode:
#  Define the Job class
#     Define the Job constructor(self, id, p, w)

#     Override the greater or equal operator(self, other)
#         Return the result of self.p/self.w>= other.p/self.w

#     Override the less than operator(self, other)
#         Return the result of self.p/self.w<other.p/self.w

#     Override the greater than operator(self, other)
#         Return the result of self.p/self.w>other.p/self.w

#  Define quicksort(ar)
#     If there is one or less elements return ar

#     Pick the middle element as pivot
#     Create two empty lists, one for objects smaller and one for objects greater than the pivot
#     If you are analyzing the pivot then skip to the next object in list
#     Put elements greater than the pivot in the list for the greater objects
#     Put elements smaller than the pivot in the list for the smaller objects
#     Put elements equal to the pivot in the greater or smaller list based on their index


#     Set as the left list the quicksorted list with objects smaller than the pivot
#     Set as the right list the quicksorted list with objects greater than the pivot
#     Return the left list, appending the pivot, appending the right list

#  Define sort(data)
#     Define an empty array of jobs

#     For every value in data
#         Create a Job object starting from the three individual values (id, p for processing time, w for importance) and add it to the list ofjobs

#     Run quicksort on the array

#     Return every id of the job in the sorted array

# which are true ? 

# The if statement at line 36, appends jobs equal to the pivot into the wrong list, 
# preventing the correct sorting of the list. FALSE
# Appending the pivot to one of the two sides isn't an error itself, it is an error adding it to a
# list and also returning it in the return statement, but doing only one of those is not an error
# itself. Also there is not a wrong list, the pivot can be appended to any list.

# The implementation is correct and contains no bug. FALSE

# The code will duplicate the pivot value of the array passed to the quicksort method. TRUE
# The code will indeed duplicate the pivot object since it will be both placed in the smaller
# list and also returned in the return statement. In this way every time the function returns,
# it will return a duplicated pivot.


# The greater and smaller lists passed to quicksort will not be correctly unpacked, preventing the correct execution.TRUE
# The lists passed as left = quicksort([smaller]) and its right counterpart will not be
# correctly unpacked since they're surrounded by brackets. This will make the list be the only
# element of another list, and when the quicksort method will run it will not be able to find
# multiple elements, the only found element will be a list of objects instead of an object.
