# Findings risky neighbourhoods.

# The water management department has a network of surveillance sensors at every corner of the Amsterdam sewage system. 
# Every sensor reports the level of chemical waste in the water. Each day the
# sensors are queried for an updated measurement roughly by neighbourhood. 
# Therefore, the measurements from sensors that are in close proximity to each other are 
# initially stored on consecutive array locations.
# The water management department takes in water from a few different random neighborhoods at a time for treatment, but has to make sure the level of chemical waste remains below a certain level. If the level is too high, nature and people will suffer.
# You are tasked with implementing an algorithm that finds the smallest subsequence in the readings (positive integers) whose sum of elements exceed the threshold defined by the water management department. If no such subsequence exists your algorithm should return 0.

# Example 1. The smallest_subsequence_length function takes two parameters:
# â€¢ array (list[int]): An array of positive integers
# â€¢ k (int)
# The function returns a the length of the smallest subsequence as an Integer.
# Call: smallest_subsequence_length([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 20)
# Returns (int): 3
