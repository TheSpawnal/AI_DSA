# this code aims to implement a binary search algorithm in a recursive way. We can assume arr array is sorted.

# Define binarysearch(arr, x)
#     If the array is empty
#         Return-1

#     Set mid var to half of the array length

#     If the middle value of the array is the searched value, then return the middle index
#     Else if the middle value is smaller than the searched value
#         then set the result to binarysearch(subarray starting from mid+1 onward, x)
#         Return the result+index of the middle index+1, if result is -1 return-1

#     else return the result of binarysearch(subarray from index 0 to mid-1, x)

#which are true

# -the algo is sub-optimal, since on line 28, the array passed to binary_Search also includes
# arr[mid] which we've already proven not equal x.FALSE
#  The slicing notation in Python allows to quickly generate a sublist. arr[:mid] means that
#  the array sublist has to range from the first index up to mid, excluding the last index (mid).
#  The slice notation includes the starting index but excludes the last. Therefore we are not
#  considering arr[mid] by returning the sublist arr[:mid].

# -The code is correct but using a linked list would reduce the execution time.FALSE
# Using a linked list would not reduce the execution time. Getting the mid element would
#  take O(n) for a list while it would take only O(1) to an array. Also, creating a new sub array
#  requires O(k) where k is the number of elements to copy, while we would need to traverse
#  the whole list (O(n)) in order to create a sublist from the second half of the list.

# -The code is correct and wouldn't be faster with a linked list. TRUE

# -Line 26 is not correct Python syntax.
#  Line 26 is correct and contains a ternary operator. Ternary operators allow to quickly write
#  simple if-else statements in a single line. They follow the syntax: A if CONDITION else B,
#  and it returns A if CONDITION is true, otherwise it returns B. It’s often used in return
#  statements and variable assignment

# - Being a Recursive algorithm, if no correct value is found, the algorithm would keep running in a loop.FALSE
# Correct recursive algorithms contain a termination condition which in this case is the first
#  if on lines 2 and 3. If the item hasn’t been found then it will return-1. In the worst case
#  the algorithm will terminate in O(log(n)).
